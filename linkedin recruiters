 რეკრუიტერებისთვის :             Dear [Recruiter's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Luka Guledani, and I am reaching out to express my deep passion and motivation to work in the backend industry.

Throughout my journey as a Junior Frontend Engineer, I have gained valuable experience and honed my skills in frontend development. However, as much as I enjoy creating seamless user experiences and crafting beautiful frontend designs, my true passion lies in backend development.

I find great joy in architecting and building the foundation of applications, designing robust APIs, and working with databases to ensure data integrity and efficient performance. The idea of creating the logic and infrastructure that powers applications excites me immensely, and I am eager to contribute my knowledge and expertise in this area.

During my internships and self-learning endeavors, I have had the opportunity to dabble in backend technologies. My experiences with Node.js, Express, and working with databases have only fueled my desire to explore the backend world further.

I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends and best practices in backend development. I am confident that my strong foundation in frontend development, coupled with my dedication and enthusiasm for backend technologies, would make me a valuable asset to any team working on ambitious projects.

I am particularly interested in opportunities at your company, as I have heard great things about your commitment to innovation and the exceptional work your team delivers. If there are any backend engineering roles available, I would be thrilled to be considered for such positions.

I would be more than happy to discuss my passion for backend development and how I can contribute to your organization's success in a call or meeting. Thank you for considering my application, and I hope to have the opportunity to work alongside your talented team.

Best regards,

Luka Guledani
